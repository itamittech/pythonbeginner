# Project Overview

This project is a simple, command-line personal budget tracker written in Python. It allows users to input their daily income and expenses, and it calculates their net savings. It also allows users to set a daily savings goal and tells them if they met their goal.

# Building and Running

This is a single-file Python script. To run it, you need to have Python installed.

**Running the script:**

```bash
python personalbudgettracker.py
```

# Development Conventions

The script is written in a procedural style. It uses f-strings for output and basic input validation is not implemented.
