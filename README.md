# Welcome to My Python Learning Journey! 🚀

This repository is my personal space for learning the Python programming language, one example at a time. I believe in learning by doing, so each file in this repository represents a new concept or a step forward in my Python journey.

## My First Step: A Personal Budget Tracker

The first example, `personalbudgettracker.py`, is a simple command-line tool to track daily income and expenses.

### Concepts Learned:

*   **User Input:** Using the `input()` function to get data from the user.
*   **Data Types:** Using `float()` to convert strings to numbers.
*   **Variables:** Storing data in variables.
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Performing calculations like subtraction.
*   **Formatted Output:** Using f-strings to display information to the user.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` to make decisions based on the user's savings.

### How to Run It:

```bash
python personalbudgettracker.py
```

I'm excited to continue this journey and add more examples as I learn!

## Next Step: A Healthy Habit Tracker

The `healthyhabittracker/healthyhabittracker.py` example is designed to help users track their daily healthy habits.

### Concepts Learned:

*   **User Input:** Taking user input for habit tracking.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Evaluating habit completion.
*   **Basic Output:** Providing feedback on habit adherence.

### How to Run It:

```bash
python healthyhabittracker/healthyhabittracker.py
```
